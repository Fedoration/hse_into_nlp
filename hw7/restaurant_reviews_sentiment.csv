"Zizi - Victoria is an average Italian restaurant. The food was decent, but not outstanding. The pasta was a bit overcooked, and the sauce lacked depth. The service was okay, but nothing special. The ambiance is nice, but the restaurant was quite noisy",1
"While the food was okay and the staff was super friendly and really fun to talk to, we found it quite strange that a large number of menu items were not available on a Monday night. Not sure if that's poor management or something else",1
Very busy Saturday for lunch for 3 of us. Theyvwere very accommodating and squeezed us in. £15 for roast pork was not worth it! All the veg and potatoes cooked from frozen clearly,1
"I use Zizzi a lot , mainly in my home town of Bristol but I was in London yesterday with my daughter and decided to grab a quick bite.  I ordered the Caprese salad -what a let down.  Completely tasteless served without the avocado",0
"Nope today wasn't great. Didn't have the fish. Then what we ordered was cold, although well heated 2nd time round hot .. just tongue burning hot.  Choice of deserts not available!. Although the wine was good",1
Food really disappointing...the prices sadly don't justify the poor quality food given! Service was ok but the food and service has really gone down compared to previous years visited. Sadly from this experience will not be visiting again,0
The service was very poor and the food wasn't anything to write home about either. We ordered the Chili Cheesy garlic bread to share and one Rigatoni Pork & Wild Garlic Meatballs each,0
"I had an absolutely terrible experience at Zizi - Victoria. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this restaurant has serious issues. The host barely acknowledged us and seemed annoyed that we didn’t have a reservation, even though the restaurant was half-empty",0
Awful food that taste like it is a microwave meal from asda and has been heated up and left under a heating light. AVOID. No easy option to decline paying service despite it being less than average,0
We visited this establishment on Saturday 17th February and found our experience very disappointing. The selection of food available was poor and the quality was of the same standard for the price paid,0
The pork and garlic meatballs were dry and bland. the mushroom risotto had one slice of a mushroom! Will not be going again soon,0
