Although the service is one of the best I've gotten in UK (nice waiters that adapted the dishes to our needs with no objections), the food was below what is expected. Lack of imagination with the dishes and poorly cooked (no contrast in the apetizierstuna, tuna completely dry, venison overcooked). In general I'd say the food was ok, but definitely not according to the price.\",\n",
