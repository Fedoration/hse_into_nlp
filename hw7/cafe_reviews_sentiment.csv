"Starbucks never disappoints! This location is particularly fantastic. The baristas are incredibly friendly and always get my order just right. The caramel macchiato is my go-to, and it’s always perfectly balanced between sweet and strong. I love the cozy seating arrangements and the free Wi-Fi, which makes it a perfect spot for working or studying. The atmosphere is inviting, with soft music playing in the background and a clean, well-maintained space",1
"I had a wonderful experience at this Starbucks. The staff were incredibly helpful and patient, especially when I was indecisive about my order. I ended up getting a chai tea latte, and it was perfect - just the right amount of spice and sweetness",1
"Starbucks has always been a favorite of mine, and this location lives up to the brand's reputation. The coffee is consistently excellent, and the baristas are always friendly and efficient. I love the variety of drinks and food items available, especially the new plant-based options",1
Lovely outside seating area local to Buckingham Palace road. Speedy service.  Toilets available on site too,1
"I really enjoy visiting this Starbucks. The coffee is always good, and the staff are friendly. My favorite drink is the mocha frappuccino, and they make it perfectly every time. The seating area is comfortable, although it can get quite busy during peak hours, which sometimes makes finding a seat difficult. The Wi-Fi is reliable, and the ambiance is pleasant, making it a good place to get some work done. Overall, a great Starbucks location that I frequent often",1
"This Starbucks is a great spot for a quick coffee run or a relaxing break. The baristas are efficient and make great drinks. I particularly enjoy the flat white here. The interior is well-designed, with a mix of seating options, including comfortable chairs and bar stools. My only complaint is that it can get a bit noisy when it's crowded, but that's to be expected. Despite that, it's one of my go-to places for coffee",1
"A solid Starbucks location with friendly staff and good coffee. I usually order the green tea latte, and it’s always made just right. The pastries are fresh and there’s a good variety to choose from. The seating area is spacious, but it can fill up quickly during peak tim",1
"This Starbucks offers a great coffee experience. The staff are polite and always make my order correctly. I love the iced caramel macchiato, and it's always refreshing. The café itself is clean and well-maintained, with plenty of seating",1
"It's a good spot very close to the Victoria coach station. Perfect when you arrive early and NEED that cup of coffee and a little snack. This place is a little crowded in the morning specially cause some travelers make this a sanitary stop as well, we even noticed and old man took a quick shower at the toilet leaving the floor all wet. Also there was a homeless man spreading his belongings all over the sitting area. I don't really care but some people where uncomfortable",1
"Good service,very small though and toilets were a bit gross",1
"Crowds of people, slow service, dirty toilet although the coffee is delicious",1
"This Starbucks is decent but not exceptional. The coffee is good, and the staff are friendly enough, but the service can be slow during busy times. I had a caramel latte, and while it was tasty, it wasn't the best I've had. The seating area is okay, but it can get quite crowded and noisy. It's a fine place for a quick coffee, but not somewhere Id choose to stay for a long time",1

Very Dirty toilets,0
"I was disappointed with my visit to this Starbucks. The coffee was lukewarm, and the service was slow. The staff seemed disorganized and overwhelmed, which resulted in a long wait time. I had a caramel macchiato, and it was below average.",0
"This Starbucks location needs improvement. The coffee was cold, and the service was very slow. The staff were not attentive and seemed more interested in chatting with each other than serving customers. I had a flat white, and it was not up to the usual standard",0
What a terrible Starbucks. Due to travel on national express coaches I've visited this Starbucks 3 times in the last week. On each occasion staff were poorly trained offering a low quality service and making mistakes when making up orders,0
The toilet is worn out and very dirty. The coffee is the worst I have drunk so far,0
"Absolutely terrible experience! The coffee was disgusting—completely burnt and undrinkable. The staff were rude and dismissive, acting like they couldn't be bothered to help",0
"Horrible service and even worse coffee. I waited 20 minutes for a simple black coffee, only to receive it lukewarm and bitter. The staff were inattentive and seemed more interested in their phones than serving customers",0
