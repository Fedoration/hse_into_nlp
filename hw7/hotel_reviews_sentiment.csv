"Lovely Hotel. Had tea and cake. Staff so amazing. We were given a wonderful welcome by Claudio. The Como had such a fantastic feel to it. Many thanks Claudio, hotel must be so proud of him. Would recommend this marvellous hotel to all visitors to the capital.",1
I had not stayed at the Halkin in quite some time...and now I'm wondering why!  I was there 5 nights and I can't think when I had a more enjoyable experience.  The room was lovely and had everything I needed including wonderful amenities..,1
COMO The Halkin is one of the most wonderful hotel experiences I have ever had.  The rooms and appointments are beautiful.  There is a designed calmness and serenity that the hotel exhibits.  Each of the staff members displays excellent.,1
"We chose to celebrate my son's birthday at COMO The Halkin, and we couldn't have made a better choice. The hotel is simply wonderful, boasting a fantastic location and beautifully appointed rooms.",1
I had afternoon tea here with a Groupon. The service was excellent. The food was not as great. There were some delicious things I ate but I can only remember one. The croquette was worth waiting for dinner time to get more. I would go back here for tea and croquettes. I want to also try their rendition of fish and chips.,1
"Great service in civilised surroundings. Quiet and discreet. The food (bar snacks) isn't bad but is expensive. That's only to be expected, though, given that you are paying for the location and the atmosphere",0
"Had the tasting menu with wine pairing. Great food, ok service",1
"I had a meeting there. I really like the place as it is quiet, nice seating and good service. I will definitely considering of having meeting there another time.",1
"Had a really lovely meal here, which was bought as a gift. At the end though a rather large tip was automatically added",1
Terrific place! Underrated exquisite tasting menu. Lots of small plates bursting with flavor,1
Lunch at Amesta using a voucher from buyagift great value. Excellent food and experience,1
"Foid was really nice and service was great, but not Michelin Star great",1
"A bit disappointed with the general experience. Although the service is one of the best I've gotten in UK (nice waiters that adapted the dishes to our needs with no objections), the food was below what is expected. Lack of imagination with the dishes and poorly cooked (no contrast in the apetizierstuna, tuna completely dry, venison overcooked). In general I'd say the food was ok, but definitely not according to the price.",1
Tbh I was expecting more! I think como’s concept of simplicity sometimes is to excessive and it sometimes seams more like a holiday inn with a better service rather than a luxury hotel. That’s only my honest opinion,1

"Ah disgusting people,beautiful restaurant but the people's attitude which working there is horrible",0
Sat outside all day waiting for a fair 2 come back,1
"Night customer service is very bad. I called and tried to book a room and the receptionist hang up my phone call without letting me finisj my sentence. Very bad attitude for no reason, bery racist and visitor-unfriendly.",0
I don’t recommend at all,0
"I participated in the refurbishment of this hotel in the cleaning team, I worked for 3 weeks and finally I gave up because I was not being paid properly. they still owe me almost £400 . Selecta agency = usurers",0
